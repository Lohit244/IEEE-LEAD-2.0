**2.jobscrapper.py: This window scraps the job from the site,"freshersworld.com"

**3.jobcomparer.py: This window scraps the jobs from the sites,"freshersworld.com" and "jobtimes.com" and helps you to compare and identify the best job from these sites.

**Additionals:I have added GUI which is very user-friendly,easy to use and understand.I have added the parameters(job title,skills,qualifications,job description,experience,last date to apply and links) which are displayed when you search any job and city. If you enter something which is vague and invalid, a popup message is displayed.
