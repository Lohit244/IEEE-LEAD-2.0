2. **WEBSITES SCRAPING:** It show the data of the first result of the site. If we search for an invalid keyword it shows no jobs availabe. 
(the data was taking quite long to upload so I trimmed the vedios to save time)

  **PROBLEMS FACED:**
  
  I didn't knew python so in the starting I faced problems with the syntax but later I found it easy specially tkinter part. Firstly  I started with naukri.com and found that it doesn't show the html so I had to use Selenium which i found really difficult. Later I managed to scrape it. After that I tried to scrape linkedIn but I wasn't able to scrape except for title and url. So I tried Monster.com .Personally I would say it's very easy to scrape site with a simple html structure otherwise it's difficult.

  **WHAT I LEARNT:**
  
  I learnt basics of python and its modules like bs4, selenium, tkinter and Pillow. It was really fun trying python for the first time.
