Link to My Portfolio: https://anitbhattacharjee.github.io/portfolio_final/

DESCRIPTION:

Made with HTML and CSS. There is no use of JavaScript. The Portfolio is made with multi color theme.
Mainly red, green, blue, yellow and black. It has many interactive animations and effects.
There are certain animations that trigger only when the cursor hovers over that makes the whole page nice.
The page is made for desktop view only. Although it is not very reactive, but it does not look terible on other devices either.
My Portfolio consists of 5 major blocks, Navigation, Introduction, About me, Skills, Projects and Contact Information.
It has many useful ways anyone can navigate throughout the page smoothly without any problems.

That is all, THANK YOU!
