                 <h3>Hello, I'm Kaustav Mitra</h3>
             <p>When I ponder at my being, at my existence and my physique, first thing that strike in my mind is my existence as a human. I am not more than a human.

                I being a human possess such qualities which distinguish me from rest of the creature of God. God has endowed human with faculty of reasoning and intellect which is the most sublime characteristic in every man.
                
                My life as a human is full of adventures, experiences and experiments. I am twenty years old boy. I study in university.
                
                I passed my college and school life where I faced many hardships and difficulties but I didnâ€™t yield to those temporary forces of world. Even I got miserably failed twice during my school life. My life is amalgamation of failures and successes.
                
                When I have a cursory glance at myself now. I truly stand indebted to my poor parents who not only supported me but encouraged me through hard times.
                
                They never lost their hope in me. After consequent failures in exams.  At last I succeeded and made my parents happy. I took second position at college level and joined university.
                
                When I was selected in university I made my mind that I have to work every waking to succeed in exams. I am punctual, regular and dedicated to my studies.
                
                Since last two years at university, I am position holder and have topped in all curricular and extra curricular activities and events celebrated annually and monthly.
                
                My aim and goal in life is to serve my family and my nation. I aim to be an army officer. Being a army officer I will safeguard the borders of my nation and provide safety and security to people.</p>
            <p> My hobbies include Sketching , playng and reading novels.
